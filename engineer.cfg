//Ver 1.4//
//Added in 1.4: Added alt-fire to mouse4 for wrangled sentries and added quickbuild for minisentries on Mouse5
//Added in 1.3: Updated the build and destroy commands due to Valve changing them is preparation to the engie update!
//Added in 1.2a:Moved Wrench over to manual
//Added in 1.2: Remembers weapon you had out before building a structure. Fixed weapon switching bug when destroying structures
//Added in 1.1: The engie will tell the team when he's building and destroying his builidngs

//This script is an absolute must for any engie. I've worked very hard to
//make this script as streamlined and bug-free as possible. It cleans up
//alot of unnessicary clicking that most engies do.
//If you have any questions email me at scott.tolksdorf@gmail.com
