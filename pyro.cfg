//Ver 1.1//

//Changelog
//1.1: Issues using airblast and the ax. Switched ax to share mouse space with flaregun

//This script has gone through many, many iterations. It started out
//trying to do everything for you. I have heavily simplified it since
//then. I've moved the melee on alot of classes that use secondary fire
//alot, making melee alot harder to reach. This became a problem with
//pyro, seeing it Axstinguisher is so powerful.

//LC:    Flame/Flare
//RC:    Airblast/Ax
//MU:    Select FlameThrower
//MD:    Select Flaregun/Ax
//M4:    Ax

//Designed for this Load-Out
//Primary  : Flamethrower
//Secondary: Flaregun
//Melee    : Ax
