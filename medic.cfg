//Ver 1.2
//Added in Ver 1.2: Removed the weird hold/click thing to launch uber, it's now the MOUSE4 button, cleaned up the script
//Added in Ver 1.1: Drops intel when you try to ubercharge, so it doesn;t fail. Added
//   Team notification when you uber. Fixed bug with needle gun not firing when selected

//This was actually the first script I ever wrote. I primarily play medic,
//and I can confidently say that this script has increased my effectiveness
//as a medic. Being able to from healing to combat with a single click removed
//much of my dependance of survival from my patent. It allows for both use of
//the mouse buttons with out removing the common way of deploying an ubercharge.

//All in all a solid script that any medic can pick up in no time.
